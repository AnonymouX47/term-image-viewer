## Installation

### Requirements
- Operating System: Unix / Linux / Mac OS X / Windows (limited support, see the [FAQs](https://termvisage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faqs.html))
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) >= 3.7
- A terminal emulator with **any** of the following:
  
  - support for the [Kitty graphics protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/).
  - support for the [iTerm2 inline image protocol](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html).
  - full Unicode support and ANSI 24-bit color support

  **Plans to support a wider variety of terminal emulators are in motion** (see the [library][term-image]'s planned features).

### Steps
The latest version can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/termvisage) with:

```shell
pipx install termvisage
```

and upgraded with:

```shell
pipx upgrade termvisage
```

**NOTE:** `pip` can also be used but `pipx` is recommended.


## Features

### CLI/TUI features
- Almost everything the [term-image] library supports
- Display individual images
- Browse multiple images and directories (recursively)
- Adjustable image grids
- Context-based controls
- Customizable controls and configuration options
- Smooth and performant experience
- and more... üòÅ


## Demo

Check out the [Gallery](https://termvisage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery.html) for more.


## Quick Start

With a file path:
```shell
termvisage path/to/image.png
```

With a URL:
```shell
termvisage https://www.example.com/image.png
```

With a directory, recursively (not currently supported on Windows):
```shell
termvisage -r path/to/dir/
```

If a single source is given and it's animated (GIF, APNG, Animated WebP), the animation is infinitely looped by **default** and can be stopped with `Ctrl-C` (`SIGINT`).

By **default**, if multiple sources or at least one directory source is given, the TUI (Terminal User Interface) is launched to navigate through the images and/or directories.


## Usage

### CLI (Command-Line Interface)
Run `termvisage --help` to see the full usage info and list of options.

See the [CLI manual](https://termvisage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html).

### TUI (Terminal User Interface)
The controls are **context-based** and always displayed at the bottom of the screen.
Pressing the `F1` key (in most contexts) brings up a **help** menu describing the available controls (called *actions*) in that context.

The TUI can be configured using a config file. See the [Configuration](https://termvisage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html) section of the docs.

[Here](https://github.com/AnonymouX47/termvisage/blob/main/vim-style_config.json) is a config file with Vim-style key-bindings (majorly navigation).

See the [TUI manual](https://termvisage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tui.html).
