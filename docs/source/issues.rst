Known Issues
============

1. The TUI is not supported on Windows.
2. Drawing images and animations doesn't work completely well with Python for windows
   (tested in Windows Terminal and MinTTY). See :ref:`here <library-issues>` for details.

   In CLI mode, use the ``--h-allow`` option to specify a horizontal allowance.

3. Some animations with the **kitty** render style within the **Kitty terminal emulator**
   might be glitchy at the moment. See :ref:`here <library-issues>` for details.
