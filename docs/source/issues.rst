Known Issues
============

1. The TUI is not supported on Windows.
2. Drawing images and animations doesn't work completely well with Python for windows
   (tested in Windows Terminal and MinTTY).
   See the `library`_\'s :external+term_image:doc:`issues` for details.

   In CLI mode, use :option:`--h-allow` to specify a horizontal allowance.

3. Some animations with the **kitty** render style within the **Kitty terminal emulator**
   might be glitchy at the moment.
   See the `library`_\'s :external+term_image:doc:`issues` for details.
