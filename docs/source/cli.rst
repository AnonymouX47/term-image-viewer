Run ``termvisage`` with the ``--help`` option to see the usage info and help text.

Note that some options are only applicable to a specific mode. If used with the other mode, they're simply ignored.

Some options have a ``[N]`` (where *N* is a number) behind their description, it indicates that the option has a footnote attached.
All footnotes are at the bottom of the help text.
